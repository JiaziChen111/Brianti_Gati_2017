\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces The red solid lines are the estimated impulse responses to our ICT shock. The shaded dark gray area and the shaded light gray area are the $90$\% and $95$\% confidence intervals, respectively, from 2000 bias-corrected bootstrap replications of the reduced-form VAR.
